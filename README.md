# GoCrypt
*by Library of Code sp-us | Faculty Marshals*

`yarn add gocrypt` || `npm install gocrypt`

**Module will only build Go binaries on Linux distros.**

GoCrypt is a package written in TypeScript for advanced crytography functions and utilities using
native Node.js crypto functions & via Go bindings.
GoCrypt's mission is to offer all the crypto-related functions and APIs any Node.js developer will need, we understand the difficulty of being able to do x509-related stuff natively. There's really no good libraries out there for making certificates or CSRs for example, we want to change that.

***WARNING:*** **This module is __not__ stable at the moment, the version will be bumped to v2.0.0 when it is stable for use.**

## Installation Requirements

- Node 10+ is heavily recommended for installation. 
- Go 1.13+ is required for installation. (https://golang.org/doc/install)
- Makefile is required for installation, (i.e. the make command that's only available on Linux, which is why this module is preferred to be used for Linux only.)
